## Experience (Three are sufficient)

- **Determination of Eligibility Criteria** (**Provisional**): Instantly checks service type, hours, and same-day multiple services
- **Calculation of Unit Counts and Estimated Amounts**: Clearly states assumptions and displays calculation process
- **Location of Notifications/Notices**: Returns “reference-type” information: notification number / date of notification / relevant chapter/section
> The goal is “certainty.” Leave gray areas as cautionary notes.

---

## Before → After

- **Verification Work**: 60 minutes → 10 minutes
- **Early Detection of Calculation Omissions**: Manual, person-dependent → Rule-based checklist
- **Reference Search**: Manual → **Location Links** (reference type)
> *Numbers are estimates. May vary by operation/region.*

## 💻 Usage Examples

Below are examples you can input into GPT:

### Input Example 1

> Is it possible to bill for a Level 2 care recipient using 30-minute home care visits focused on daily living assistance 3 times a week? What is the monthly unit count?

#### GPT Output Example:

* **Conclusion:** For a user with Care Level 2 receiving 30-minute daily living assistance-focused services 3 times per week, **billing is possible**. However, daily living assistance-focused services require **certain conditions to be met**, such as living alone or having difficulty with family support.
* **Unit Calculation:** 183 units × 12 sessions = **2,196 units** (Estimated cost: ¥21,960 ※¥10 per unit)
* **Legal Basis:** Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare Notification No. ○ (2024 Long-Term Care Insurance Fee Revision)

### Input Example 2

> Under what conditions can the initial service fee be calculated? How long is the calculation period?

### Input Example 3

> If two home care services are provided on the same day, can each be calculated separately? How is it calculated?

---

## Design Principles

- **Always explicitly state prerequisites**. (Unit price, regional surcharge, same-day multiple services, etc.)
- **Include wording to prevent incorrect billing**. Clearly state possibilities, reservations, and final confirmation.

---

##  Important Notes

- This tool is for **reference purposes only**.
- The final decision must be made by the **responsible person or expert** at the facility.
- Laws and unit prices are subject to change due to revisions. Always verify the **latest official sources**.
